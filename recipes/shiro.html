    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Shiro Mix</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup Sunflower oil</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion </li>
        <li>1 medium tomato diced</li>
        <li>4 cup of water </li>
        <li>Salt as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium size pot, cook the onions on medium-high heat for several minutes, stirring frequently, until they start to get brown.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and cook for a few more minutes. </li>
        <li>Continue to saut√© for another 2-3 minutes then add tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cook for 4-5 minutes.  Add 3 cup of water and continue to simmer</li>
        <li>Start adding Shiro mix gradually, stirring with a wire whisk until all lumps disappear. Shiro will start to get thick and pop.</li>
        <li>Let it cook for 15 - 20 minutes </li>
        <li>Continuously add a small amount of water, while stirring for 1-2 minutes or until desired Shiro thickness.</li>
        <li>With more cooking time, Shiro stew will continue to become thicker.  It's always best to add a small amount of extra water and let it cook for an additional 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and salt (as needed), stir well, and continue simmering until oil starts appearing for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
