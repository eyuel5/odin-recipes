                <h3>How to make Ethiopian delicious Tibs</h3>
                <p>
                    Tibs is an Ethiopian dish consisting of stir fried meat and vegetables, flavored with berbere (fairly
                    hot blend of spices).
                </p>
                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large red onion, about 2 cups, sliced thin</li>
                    <li>&frac14; cup niter kebbeh or ghee spiced butter</li>
                    <li>2 pounds venison, lamb or beef, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons berbere</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground fenugreek</li>
                    <li>&frac12; teaspoon cardamom (optional)</li>
                    <li>&frac12; teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                    <li>&frac14; teaspoon cumin</li>
                    <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground clove</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 to 4 garlic cloves, sliced thinly</li>
                    <li>2 cups whole peeled tomatoes, broken into bits</li>
                    <li>1 to 5 green chiles, such as jalapenos or serranos</li>
                    <li>&frac12; cup red wine</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get the saute pan or wok very hot. Stir-fry the onions without the butter for a few minutes, until
                        they char just a little on the outside. Add the spiced butter and the venison. Stir-fry hot and fast
                        until the outside of the meat is brown but the inside of the meat is still very rare. You need to do
                        this on as hot a burner as you have. Do it in two batches unless you have a very large wok or pan.
                    </li>
                    <li>The moment the meat has browned, add it all back into the pan along with the spices, garlic and
                        chiles. Stir-fry another 30 seconds or so, then add the tomatoes and the wine. Toss to combine and
                        let this cook for a minute or two. Serve at once with bread or injera.</li>
