		Ethiopian food is one of the most delicious cuisines in the world. Ethiopian cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes like Doro Wot, Tibs, Kitfo, Gomen kitfo, Gomen ba siga. This is usually in the form of wat, a thick stew, served on top of injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour.

		Also, Ethiopian food is well flavored with a mixture of different spices and herbs, not extremely spicy in heat, but rather very well seasoned. This includes Berbere (mixture of Chili powder, fenugreek, ginger, garlic, cardamom, cinnamon ...), Mitmita, Awaze (paste version of berbere) and Niter kibbeh (Ethiopian Spiced Butter).
